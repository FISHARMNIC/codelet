Shows pointers etc.
Uses WASM

todos:

function callable in c like js_showstring() and the memory like highlights it

errors in compiler dont unlock editor

sliders/numbers to set memory inspection size

use fly.io for server?

maybe padd @addr correctly in MODE_MAP (expects all addrs to be of same size)

Mode to only manually insert breakpoints where needed

Maybe use c++ (em++) for arduino sim lessons

slider for speed in unpaused mode

auto lineNo in js_break by adding 1 to prev bp since pp inserts __wasm_break__ before and after

map doesn go back to dump

add stop on memory change

do addview for structs too
    -> using special macro where you create structs differently and it captures everything

structs with curly brackets and list inits cause breakpoints
